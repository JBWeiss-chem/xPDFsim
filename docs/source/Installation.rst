Installation
############

Make sure to have some version of conda installed. It is recommended to create a new environment.

.. code-block::

    conda create -n xPDFsim

And then activate it.

.. code-block::

    conda activate xPDFsim

Then you can install it using pip.

.. code-block::

    pip install xPDFsim

If this does not work because pip is not installed, install it via conda first.

.. code-block::

    conda install pip
